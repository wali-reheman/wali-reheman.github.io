Hey, thanks for stopping by! 👋🏼<br><br>

I'm an Adjunct Lecturer and doctoral student of `Political Science` at [American University](https://www.american.edu/).<br><br>

My research focuses on ethnic and religious identity politics, political socialization, and public opinion. <br><br>

I am currently working with Dr. [David Lublin](https://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/dlublin.cfm) to study in-group support for ethnic parties using the ecological Bayesian inference method, and with Dr. [Elizabeth Suhay](https://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/suhay.cfm) to examine how meritocratic values evolve across four generations of American immigrants and how they affect American immigrants’ policy preferences. I also work with Dr. [Sharan Grewal](https://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/sgrewal.cfm) to explore radical right parties' impact on public opinion among Muslim minority in Europe.
