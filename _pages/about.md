Hey, thanks for stopping by! üëãüèº
  
I'm an Adjunct Lecturer and doctoral student of `Political Science` at [American University](https://www.american.edu/).
  
My research focuses on ethnic and religious identity politics, political socialization, and public opinion. 
  
I am currently working with Dr. [David Lublin](https://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/dlublin.cfm) to study in-group support for ethnic parties using the ecological Bayesian inference method, and with Dr. [Elizabeth Suhay](https://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/suhay.cfm) to examine how meritocratic values evolve across four generations of American immigrants and how they affect American immigrants‚Äô policy preferences.

I am also a member of the [Political Behavior Research Group](https://www.american.edu/spa/political-behavior-research-group.cfm) and the [Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies](https://www.american.edu/spa/ccps/).
