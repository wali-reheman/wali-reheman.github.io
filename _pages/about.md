Hey, thanks for stopping by! üëãüèº

I'm a PhD student of Political Science at [American University](https://www.american.edu/).

I study comparative politics and political methodology, concentrating on ethnic politics, political socialization, and public opinion.

I'm currently working with Dr. David Lublin, assisting in his work on minority representation and inclusion. I'm also working with Dr. Elizabeth Suhay on the political socialization of American immigrants.
