Hey, thanks for stopping by! üëãüèº

I'm a PhD student of `Political Science` at [American University](https://www.american.edu/).

I study comparative politics and political methodology, concentrating on ethnic politics, political socialization, and public opinion.

I'm currently working with Dr. [David Lublin](https://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/dlublin.cfm), assisting in his work on minority representation and inclusion. I'm also working with Dr. [Elizabeth Suhay](https://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/suhay.cfm) on the generational change of American immigrants' inequality attribution. I'm also working with Dr. [Junyan Jiang](https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/junyan-jiang) on the History of the Chinese Communist Party Organizations.
