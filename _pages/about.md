Hey, thanks for stopping by! üëãüèº

I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. student of `Political Science` at [American University](https://www.american.edu/).

My research focuses on ethnic and religious identity politics, political socialization, and public opinion. 

I am currently collaborating with Dr. [David Lublin](https://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/dlublin.cfm) to study ingroup support for ethnic parties using the ecological inference method, and with Dr. [Elizabeth Suhay](https://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/suhay.cfm) to examine how meritocratic values evolve across generations among American immigrants and how they affect American immigrants‚Äô policy preferences.
