## Basic Knowledge

If I have to pick one book to recommend to social science students for a foundational understanding of statistics, it would be:

- [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/index.html)

This book provides a practical introduction to statistical modeling and data analysis from a Bayesian perspective, which complements frequentist methods by emphasizing predictions and Bayesian model averaging. Co-authored by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari, the text builds on simple foundations to develop an intuitive understanding of regression models. Itâ€™s particularly useful for those who want a deep dive into the philosophy and application of statistics in the social sciences. The accompanying examples and code in R make it accessible and practically oriented, ensuring that readers not only understand statistical concepts but also know how to implement them in real-world scenarios.

## Look at your Data

### Statistical inference based on observational data

As a student, we are at really early stage of our career, it might be hard for us to get first-hand data. Starting from existing datasets might be helpful, there are always good research published using existing observational datasets. Dr. Yiqing XU has a very useful checklist for conducting research using observational data:
