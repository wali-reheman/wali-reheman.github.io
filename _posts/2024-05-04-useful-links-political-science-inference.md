## Basic Knowledge

If I have to pick one book to recommend to social science students for a foundational understanding of statistics, it would be:

- [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/index.html)

This book provides a practical introduction to statistical modeling and data analysis from a Bayesian perspective, which complements frequentist methods by emphasizing predictions and Bayesian model averaging. Co-authored by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari, the text builds on simple foundations to develop an intuitive understanding of regression models. Itâ€™s particularly useful for those who want a deep dive into the philosophy and application of statistics in the social sciences. The accompanying examples and code in R make it accessible and practically oriented, ensuring that readers not only understand statistical concepts but also know how to implement them in real-world scenarios.
