## Introduction to Practical Statistical Learning

Embarking on your journey as a first-year PhD student can be overwhelming, especially when you're faced with the seemingly daunting realm of statistics. But here's a reassuring truth: you don't need to be an advanced statistician to excel in research. Instead of focusing on highly technical methods right from the start, you can develop a strong foundation by taking a practical approach to statistical learning.

As students, we sometimes fall into the trap of believing that mastering complex statistical concepts is the only way to conduct rigorous research. In reality, understanding the essentials and applying them effectively is far more valuable. The goal should be to develop a clear comprehension of statistical inference, explore data thoughtfully, and apply appropriate models for your research questions.

This blog will guide you through practical strategies for approaching statistical inference, including resources, tools, and best practices that can build your confidence. We will explore the significance of understanding your data, introduce foundational resources like "Regression and Other Stories," and discuss practical ways to implement statistical models, even if you're not an expert in advanced techniques. By adopting this mindset, you'll be better equipped to handle real-world data challenges and contribute valuable insights to the field.

Ultimately, remember that learning statistics is a gradual process, and it's important to build skills over time. With persistence, curiosity, and a practical approach, you'll find yourself making meaningful progress in statistical learning.

## Basic Knowledge

If I have to pick one book to recommend to social science students for a foundational understanding of statistics, it would be:

- [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/index.html)

This book provides a practical introduction to statistical modeling and data analysis from a Bayesian perspective, which complements frequentist methods by emphasizing predictions and Bayesian model averaging. Co-authored by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari, the text builds on simple foundations to develop an intuitive understanding of regression models. Itâ€™s particularly useful for those who want a deep dive into the philosophy and application of statistics in the social sciences. The accompanying examples and code in R make it accessible and practically oriented, ensuring that readers not only understand statistical concepts but also know how to implement them in real-world scenarios.

## Look at your Data

### Statistical inference based on observational data

As a student, we are at really early stage of our career, it might be hard for us to get first-hand data. Starting from existing datasets might be helpful, there are always good research published using existing observational datasets. Dr. Yiqing XU has a very useful checklist for conducting research using observational data:
